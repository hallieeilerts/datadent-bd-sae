## 1st time running with all covariates
# child_age, hhd_head_sex, hhd_head_age, mother_age are important
## Dropping child_age and running again, because was not important at all in ors and zinc, and super important in allvac
# mother_age, hhd_head_age, hhd_head_sex, hhd_under5, wealth_index
## mother_age is highly correlated with hhd_under5, not hhd_head_age... going to drop it and see what happens though.
## hhd_head_age is only really important for ors. Try dropping that one instead of mother_age.
# looks better. mother_age important to allvac and zinc.
# hhd_head_sex, mother_age, hhd_under5, residence
## dropping hhd_under5 because highly correlated with mother_age
# hhd_head_sex, mother_age, wealth_index

## After I fit all the models, these covariates didn't work well for ch_diar_ors
# ch_allvac_either was also not fine in the model with 2 covariates. but this no big deal.
# wealth_index was third covariate. so seems to have been causing problems
# testing VIF and with wealth_index, variance for the three covar neared 1 or more
# i tried hhd_head_sex, mother_age, mother_edu (instead of wealth_index) - still high
# taking a different approach-- try hhd_head_sex, hhd_head_age, hhd_under5
# because would be nice to include number of kids under five, and this one is less correlated with mother_age
# nevermind = VIF is close to 1.5 for some indicators
# go back to hhd_head_sex, hhd_head_age, mother_edu (instead of wealth_index)
# looks good.

## Third time. These covariates didn't work well for all 3-- ch_diar_zinc, ch_diar_ors, ch_allvac_either.
# Including all covariates
# keep mother_age, drop hhd_head_age

## 1st time running with all covariates except child_age
# note that nt_wm_micro_iron and nt_wm_micro_iron_any are essentially the same indicators
# hhd_under5, residence
## will remove mother_age due to collinearity with hhd_under5
# hhd_under5,
# then wealth_index from second plot
## exclude residence due to collinearity with wealth_index
# hhd_under5, hhd_head_age, wealth_index
# don't want to include both maternal_edu and wealth_index due to collinearity
